The fields EID and DOI are new, and are not yet standard for
all BibTeX files, but I hope they will be soon.

EID is what AGU calls "citation number" and what other publishers
 call "sequence number". It replaces the page number for electronic
 journals.

Recall rules for title: words that are always to be capitalized are
   placed in {Curly Braces} while other words should be capitalized
   as they would be printed for those journals that like capitalized
   titles; for other journals, like AGU, these words will be set in
   lower case.

These rules do not apply to BOOKTITLE, which is printed as is.

The first letter of a note text will also be set in lower case, unless
  placed in curly braces.
